### The Aiming Game
This is a simple game where you can aim using a bow. It took me quite a while to get the stretchable mechanism working properly.

The idea for this game came to me while my roommates were having discussions about wars in the past. Inspired by those conversations—and with a slight nod to the Mahabharata (though not too much)—I created this game. I also tried to add a techie touch by experimenting with font styles and aesthetics.

AI was used sparingly in this project, primarily for detecting the stretching and pull-back of the arrow from the bow, as well as for some bug fixing.
